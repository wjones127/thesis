# Hierarchical Models for Crowdsourced Bicycle Route Ratings
This is my undergraduate thesis, currently in progress and to be completed May
of 2016. 

In this thesis, I examine a dataset of crowdsourced ratings of urban bicycle
rides, and attempt to create a model that predicts ride ratings from ride
and route level variables. 

## File Structure
This repository is an R package with several bonus folders. They are:

- **analysis**: contains exploratory analysis from original work on data
manipulation and cleaning.
- **data**: contains some data. For privacy and license reasons, most of the
data is not availible in the repository. 
- **logs**: contains weekly logs reporting work done for the past week. 
- **R**: contains R functions written as part of the package to manipulate data
- **thesis**: contains thesis PDF and source files. (The thesis document is
created from an R markdown template, which can be found at
