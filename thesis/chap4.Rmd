# Model 1: Rides and Riders

We start out model simply and then building up. The first problem to approach is

effects terms and demonstrates the improvement in the models fit and predictive
accuracy over more classical models.

## Choosing Ride-Level Parameters

## Adding Random Effects from Riders

## Evaluating the Ride-Level Models
