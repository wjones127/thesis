# Modeling Missing Response {#missing-data}

We have a significant portion of observations with no response. But we do have
all the predictors for every observation. So just as we built a model to predict
the rating, can we build a model to predict whether a rider will give a rating?
Going further, could we combine our rating model and nonresponse model into one
model, such that our predictions for ratings will take into account biases in
nonresponse?

We attempt to address these two questions in this chapter. The methods we present
in this chapter could improve inference greatly on this data, but we do have
concerns about the current quality of the data for which there are no reponses.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, one big problem with data collection is that rides
are often misclassified as bike rides when they are actually car rides or rides
on public transit. We suspect that many of the unrated rides are rides that
were misclassified as bike rides, and thus were not rated by the rider. (We
assume that riders don't often go through the effort of correcting the
classification of rides and know not to rate rides that weren't bike rides.)
That being said, this issue could potentially be fixed and these methods used
again in the future.

## What could possibly go wrong?

We focus on the situation we have, where our response variable $y_i$ has 
missing values. Define the vector $R = (r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n)$ such that

\begin{equation}
r_i = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1, & \text{if } y_i \text{ is missing};\\
0, & \text{if } y_i \text{ is observed};
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

Rubin classifies missing data into three situations^[@little1987 (page 14)]:

1. **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**, where $R$ is independent of $Y$ and
   the predictors $X$. *i.e.*, $\mathbb{P} (R = 1| Y, X) = \mathbb{P}(R = 1$.)
2. **Missing at Random (MAR)**, where $R$ is independent of $Y$, but may 
   depend on $X$, *i.e.* $\mathbb{P} (R = 1 |Y, X) = \mathbb{P} (R = 1 | X )$
3. **Nonignorable, or not MCAR nor MAR**, where $R$ is dependent on $Y$.

We believe that rider ratings may be correlated with nonresponse. One explanation:
riders who have a unpleasant experience on the road might feel more incentive
to report their experience on the app than those who had a ride that was
uneventful. This motivates our exploration of missing data models, though, of
course, is by no means evidence of nonignorable missing data.
   
If missing data is nonignorable, what could go wrong with our models? Let look 
at a toy example. Define the data set of $n$ observations with $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$,
$y \in \{0,1\}^n$, and $R$ defined as before, where
$$x_i \sim \text{Normal}(0,1),$$
$$y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\text{logit}^{-1} (4x_i)),$$
$$r_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(0.3 + 0.4 y_i),$$
for $i = 1, \ldots, n$.

\caption[Simulated example of biased estimates from nonignorable missing data.]{Simulated example of logistic regression fits to a model with nonignorable
missing response. One data set of size $n = 10^4$ was computed from the toy data model.
We then recomputed $R$ 1,000 times, each time fitting a simple logistic regression
model to $Y$ and $X$. \label{fig:missing-model1-estimates}}
\end{figure}


If we attempt to fit a logistic regression model to this data, our slopes will
be unbiased but our estimate of the intercept will be biased. 
`r ref("missing-model1-estimates")` shows the results of a simulation, computing
the slope and intercepts for 1,000 different patterns of missing data for the
same generated data set generated from our toy data model.

It makes sense that we are underestimating our intercept. The intercept can be
interpreted as the base rate, and if values of $y_i = 1$ are more likely to be
 missing, the overall rate we observe will be lower.
 
Clearly, if we have nonignorable missing response, we are in a bad situation. 
Having missingness depend on $Y$ leads to biased estimates of our intercepts
when we fit models. But we do have all of our predictors of $y$, with no
missingness. Could we leverage our understanding of how $X$ predicts $Y$ to
understand the patterns of missing response?

## Modeling the Missing Data Mechanism with Expectation Maximization {#em-algorithm}

Here we perform the expectation maximization algorithm using the
weighting method proposed by Ibrahim and Lipsitz^[@ibrahim1996]. Let 
$y_i$ be our binary response and $x_i$ be our predictors. With these we have
our complete data logistic regression model $f(y_i \;|\; x_i, \beta)$, where
$\beta$ is a vector of parameters in the complete data model.

We then specify a logistic regression model for missingness
(the $r_i$'s): $f(r_i \;|\; x_i, y_i, \alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is the vector of
parameters in the missingness model.

We begin the algorithm by getting our first estimates of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
We obtain $\beta^{(1)}$ by estimating $\beta$ with only the non-missing data.
We can then estimate the $y_i$ for the missing data using $\beta^{(1)}$, and
then use those estimates to compute $\alpha^{(1)}$.

For the E-step, we compute weights for each observation with missing response

\begin{equation}
w_{i\: y_i}^{(t)} = 
f(y_i \;|\; r_i, x_i, \alpha^{(t)}, \beta^{(t)}) =
\frac{f(y_i \;|\; x_i, \beta^{(t)}) f(r_i \;|\; x_i, y_i, \alpha^{(t)})}{
\sum_{y_i \in \{0,1\}}
f(y_i \;|\; x_i, \beta^{(t)}) f(r_i \;|\; x_i, y_i, \alpha^{(t)})
}.
\end{equation}

For observed responses, $w_{i\: y_i}^{(t)} = 1$. Note that for each observation 
$i$, $\sum_{y_i \in \{0,1\}} w_{i\; y_i} = 1.$  We can compute
$f(y_i \;|\; x_i, \beta^{(t)})$ and $f(r_i \;|\; x_i, y_i, \alpha^{(t)})$ by 
making use of predictions from regression models. So in \textit{R}, we can
fit models and use the `predict()` function to get our probabilities from
each of these models.

For the M-step, we find our next estimates of the parameters, $\alpha^{(t + 1)}$
and $\beta^{(t + 1)}$, by maximizing

\begin{equation}
Q(\alpha, \beta \;|\; \alpha^{(t)}, \beta^{(t)}) =
\sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{y_i \in \{0,1\}} w_{iy_i}^{(t)} \cdot 
l(\alpha, \beta | x_i, y_i, r_i).
\end{equation}

We do this by first by estimating $\beta^{(t + 1)}$ using weighted maximum
likelihood for the complete data model, and then estimating $\alpha^{(t + 1)}$
using the same method. To maximize $l(\alpha, \beta | x_i, y_i, r_i)$, we 
maximize the product of their likelihoods,
$$l(\alpha, \beta | x_i, y_i, r_i) = l(\beta | x_i, y_i) l(\alpha | r_i, x_i, y_i),$$
which we can maximize by maximize each of the likelihoods separately because
our estimates of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are only dependent on each other through
$x$ and $y$. This allows us to use
any package that can fit models by maximum likelihood estimation using weights
for the observations, which includes all of the model fitting packages we used
in Chapter 3.

In order to create the data to fit these
models, we create an augmented data set where  each observation missing the
response is recorded as two rows. These duplicate rows represent the two possible
values of the response, and also contain the weights computed in the E-step.
`r ref("augmented-data")` describes this process graphically.

1 & -0.4 & 0 & 0.2\\
0 & -0.4 & 0 & 0.8
\end{tabular}\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

We repeat the E and M step until the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ converge.

As an example, we simulated a dataset from the same model we presented earlier
of size $10^4$. Of those observations, 6,252 were missing. 
As shown in `r ref("EM-sim", type = "table")`, the estimate for
the intercept in the model that only considers the complete data is way off, but
the model resulting from the EM algorithm are nearly as accurate as the model 
computed fit to the full data (with missing values filled in from the original
data model.) The missing data model is also able to get accurate estimates of
the parameters that define the missing data mechanism, but the estimates are
quite uncertain.

## Creating a Missing Data Model

In order to perform the algorithm, we need to specify a model for nonresponse.
We will the same predictors that we do in Model 4 for ride rating---including
a smoothing spline for time of day for weekdays and weekends---except
we do not use random rider intercepts. We can specify a basic nonresponse model as

\begin{equation}
r_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\text{logit}^{-1} (\alpha + x_i \beta + \mathcal{S}(t_i))).
\end{equation}

For the EM algorithm, we use Model 4 as our ride rating model and use the following
model for the rating nonresponse mechanism:

\begin{equation}
r_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\text{logit}^{-1} (\alpha + y_i \beta_Y + x_i \beta + \mathcal{S}(t_i))).
\end{equation}
