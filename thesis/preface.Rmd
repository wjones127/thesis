Given cyclists' commuting bicycle routes and their ratings of those routes, how
can we determine which infrastructure features are not working for bicyclists?
This is the question that first fascinated me when I started this thesis. As
someone just getting into statistics, it was a mind boggling problem at the time,
and even now I still don't have a complete answer; it turned out to be a larger
research question than could fit in one undergraduate thesis. But here I make some
substantial steps forward, refining the question ("how can we model how ride
ratings are influenced by route, as well as weather, who is riding, and when
they are riding?"), addressing part of the question (the non-route part), and 
coming up with some ideas on how to proceed further.

This thesis represents a year's worth of hard work and the most enlightening 
educational experience I've had yet. It was a deep dive into how to do
statistical modeling for a rich and complex data set with many open questions.
During this undertaking, I couldn't be more thankful for the guidance of Andrew 
Bray, my thesis adviser.

The story of how I got interested in this data was just as much a story of 
Reedies helping Reedies as it was of fascination with technical challenges.
I first encountered *Ride Report* during Rennie Meyers' '15 presentation of her final
project in the Introduction to Data Science class taught by Albert
Kim in the spring of 2016. In a turn of luck, I found myself during the following summer
interning at Switchboard (more formally known as Weathergram, Inc.), who shared
an office with Knock Software, the creators of the *Ride Report* app. During
that summer I got to talk with William Henderson '08 and Evan Heidtmann, the two
developers at Knock, and became fascinated with the open questions in the data.
I have to thank Rennie Meyers for sharing what she learned and
Switchboard introducing me to William and Evan, but most of all thesis would not be possible
without the generosity of William and Evan. They not only
allowed me to examine the data they are obligated to keep as private as possible, 
but hosted me for hours in their office while I ran and debugged my models.

Few feats at Reed are possible without the support of loved ones, and I've been
especially fortunate here. I got through this semester in no small part because
of the times I spend sharing great food with my friend Xian; the loving reassurance and
support of my partner Kiki; and, of course, the love and financial support of
my mom Kathleen.
