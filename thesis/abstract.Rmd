We examine a dataset of crowdsourced commuter bicycle route ratings in Portland,
OR. Multilevel model results show that ratings are best modelled when riders
are modelled as having differing tendencies to rate their rides negatively. We
also show that the majority of variation in ride ratings across time of day is
owed to patterns in who is riding, rather than any effect particular to that
day, such as traffic. A brief exploration in clustering shows that some small
patterns in cyclists patterns can be picked out, but that these patterns do
not provide much useful information to predict rider ratings.
