## The Data Frames

So I've gotten the data frames together. Oddly, there seems to be four copies of 
each ride in the data. It seems to be split so that two rides have the variable
`rr_transformation` is `simplify` and the other two rides have `match`. 

I will ask William about this, but wow this totally solved the how many 
observations mystery. I guess this is why exploratory data analysis is such a big
deal.


TO DO:
- Get response from William about data
- Create shapefile of street segments
- Subset data
