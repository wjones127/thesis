# Week 22

## Progress

### Oral Examiners

Emailed Noel, but sadly she had a conflict. So does Darrell from physics. Will
contact more people soon.

- Anna Ritz in computational bio
- Email Troy Cross
- Susie
- Tamara Metz, poly sci
- Kara Becker, linguistics
- James Gruber


### Plot functions

I rewrote the prob plot in C++. There are some really great tools in R for
profiling code and the integration with C++ is amazing! It goes pretty fast now.
Reduced the computation time from about 15 minutes to 15 seconds. Pretty
impressive. Will write up how it work in a bit.
