# Week 22

## Progress

### Oral Examiners

Emailed Noel, but sadly she had a conflict.

I contact Darrell in the physics department. I should hear back from him soon.

### Plot functions

I rewrote the prob plot in C++. There are some really great tools in R for
profiling code and the integration with C++ is amazing! It goes pretty fast now.
Reduced the computation time from about 15 minutes to 15 seconds. Pretty
impressive. Will write up how it work in a bit.

### TO DO

- Add to introduction about crowdsourced data
- Write about the bias variance trade-off in context of crowdsourced data. What
  implications does this have for my analysis?
- Write missing data exploration
- Write up section on the plots I created
- Write a better summary of thesis. Add to resume and github page.
- Create missing data models
- Fix the prediction function for additive models
- Write up methods on additive models
