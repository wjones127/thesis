# Thesis Log Week 14

## Ratings research

I found a few papers that might be relevant to ratings and hierarchical models:

- Mackaronis, Julia. "Beholder and Beheld: A Multilevel Model of Perceived Sexual Appeal"

I have yet to spend a significant time reading them, but I hope they point me
in the right direction as far as how to model rider preferences.

## Ride segment research

I realized that the road segments could be considered groups to which a ride
can be a part of several. (This is essentially how I have written it up in the
model.) This makes me wonder if there are any previously studied approaches to
modelling data in which individuals may be members of several groups of the same
type.
