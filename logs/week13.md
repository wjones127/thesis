# Thesis Log Week 13

Originally, I though I would run a model in the next week, but after writing the
code up, I realized I have some unanswered questions that I need. I don't really
have good motivations for my variables besides ride length and rider, and would
like to run a few exploratory tests first to motivate using those as a model.

I've outlined how I might run the model in `analysis/first_model.Rmd`. I've 
started outlining an exploratory analysis in `analysis/exploration1.Rmd`.


# Data
So weather data has been a bit hard to come by. Ideally, I would like hourly
measurements of temperature and rainfall for 2012 to the present.
