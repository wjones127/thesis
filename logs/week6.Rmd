So far I have loaded the personal data and created a couple of maps. I am still
working on those functions to really work with assigning streets and creating a
basic model.

Side note: One of the barriers to making these notes on time is that I spend
most of Wednesday nights working on *The Quest*, and thus most work I put off
for Wednesday ends up not getting done. 

# TO DO

- Finish up the data frames
- Email RIDE report about alternate method for anon data, and clarify information
- Create funtion to filter rides based on 
- Implement naive segment matching / averaging
