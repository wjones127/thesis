# Thesis Log: Week 20

Worked on chapter 4 for my thesis writing. It took longer than expected, mainly
because it was a busy week. I have a pretty decent draft of most of the model
specifications, but I need to do a little more research into smoothing splines
so I can explain what I am doing with the non-parametric time terms and 
additive models. 

## Some questions for Andrew

- How do orals work? Should I be finding people for orals? What should I do to
prepare?

- Should I include a time of day variable?

## A new timeline

Ideally I could run a iteration of the first models in the next week, so that
I could write those results up over break. To get those models ready, I need to

- make probability plots minimize MSE or AIC
- write function for additive model output
- write specification of each model
- implement cross validation
- test formatting of plots
- schedule model running time with Evan

I will make missing data models chapter 5, and write that up.

I will also start looking back at the route data and trying to work on that
problem again. Hopefully I will come up with something.
