# Week 1 Sept 17 - 24

This wasn't a super productive week for my thesis. But I have done a few
important things.

## Getting the Data

William confirmed that I can use the data, and we are getting coffee next Tuesday
to talk more about the data and I'm assuming I will get it soon after that. In
the mean time, I at least can look at what has been done in Rennie's project.

## Started Research

Linda and I had a little trouble finding appropriate papers related to this
topic. We did find one that was promising, in which they were creating a traffic
model based on traces from taxi GPS. I think there are things I can learn from 
this paper, though I need more time to study it.

There are some smaller areas I think I will need to examine, such as best 
practices when analyzing data from online ratings. 

## Other thoughts

One possible way to look at paths is as a 'bag of streets', in the same way that
text analysis sometimes model sentences with a 'bag of words' assumption. Then by
splitting the GPS coordinates into observations of going through a street, I
could take inspiration for a model from those text anaylsis models.

## Plans for next week

I will explore the research done by Rennie on visualization, which will give me
some good questions to ask William when I meet with him on Tuesday.
